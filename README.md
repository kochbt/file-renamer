# file-renamer
File Renamer is a tool in the form of an executable python file used to automate the process of renaming files in a directory. Specifically, File Renamer was created to handle a situation where the user exports a large number of log files which were automatically numbered [filename].1, [filename].2, etc. Upon opening each file the user is prompted to select the program they want to use to open the filetype of .1, .2, etc. File Renamer changes every file within it's directory (except for itself) to a sequentially numbered file that ends in the extension ".txt" so each file will automatically open in the desired text editor.
